    <h3>How to make Pizza</h3>
    
    <p>Pizza is relatively easy to make, but incredibly hard to master. 
        Starting with quality ingredients is the first important choice: 
        the dough, the cheese, the tomato sauce, the toppings all play a very important role
        here. Next you have to take a fine touch and good awareness of how the ingredients will
        lay on the pizza while it cooks. Finally you have to cook at the proper 
        temperatures and times to ensure the cook is even without burning. Let's organize 
        the ingredients and then explore the steps.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Dough</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Cheese - can be mozzarella and various other blends, shredded</li>
            <li>Meats and vegetables as desired</li>
            <li>Oregano, chili flakes, other seasonings as desired</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The fresh dough must be coated in flour (to prevent sticking) 
        and spread thin using pressure from your hands. 
        Or alternatively the dough can be tossed into the air and spun.</li>
        <li>Evenly pour the pizza sauce coating the entire surface area of the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cheese blends over the entire surface of the dough/sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the desired meat and vegetable ingredients on top of the cheese blend.</li>
        <li>Place the raw pizza in an oven and cook for 10-15 minutes at 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and cut into 8 slices using a pizza cutter.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle seasonings as desired and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
